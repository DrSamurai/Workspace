Create a class called "Vehicle" that serves as the base class for all types of vehicles. 
The class should have the following attributes:

A protected int variable called "numWheels" that represents the number of wheels on 
the vehicle.
A protected String variable called "vehicleType" that represents the type of vehicle 
(e.g. "car", "motorcycle", "bicycle").
A protected double variable called "maxSpeed" that represents the maximum speed of 
the vehicle.
The class should also have the following methods:

A public abstract method called "drive()" that takes no arguments and returns 
no value. This method should be overridden by subclasses to 
provide a specific implementation for driving the vehicle.

A public void method called "displayVehicleType()" that takes no arguments and 
returns no value. This method should simply display the value of 
the "vehicleType" attribute.

A public void method called "displayNumWheels()" that takes no arguments and
 returns no value. This method should simply display the value of 
the "numWheels" attribute.

Create three subclasses of Vehicle: "Car", "Motorcycle", and "Bicycle". 
Each of these classes should provide an implementation of the "drive()" 
method and set the appropriate values for the "numWheels" and "vehicleType" 
attributes. In the main class, create objects of each of the three 
subclasses and call the "drive()" method for each object, as well as the 
"displayVehicleType()" and "displayNumWheels()" methods.
