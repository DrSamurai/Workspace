"Write a function that takes in a 2D array and the dimensions of the array
as arguments, and returns a pointer to the minimum value in the array. The function
should have the following signature:

int *find_min(int arr[][], int rows, int cols);

Your function should return a pointer to the minimum value in the array. If
the array is empty (i.e., either rows or cols is 0), the function should return a null pointer.
// int* ptr; = NULL

For example, given the following array:

int arr[][] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};

The call to find_min(arr, 3, 3) should return a pointer to the value 1.

You may assume that the array passed to the function is a valid 2D array
with at least one element. You should not modify the original array in any way."


Define minimum beforehand
