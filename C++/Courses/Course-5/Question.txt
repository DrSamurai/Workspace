Create a C++ class "Vehicle" with private member variables "make", 
"model", and "year", and public member functions "setMake", "setModel", 
and "setYear" to set the values of these variables. 

Then, create a class "Car" that inherits from "Vehicle" and has private member variables 
"numberOfDoors" and "tankCapacity", and public member functions 
"setNumberOfDoors" and "setTankCapacity" to set the values of these 
variables. 

Create another class "Truck" that also inherits from "Vehicle" 
and has private member variable "payloadCapacity" and public member function 
"setPayloadCapacity" to set the value of this variable. 

Create a class "SUV" that inherits from both "Car" and "Truck" and has a 
private member variable "fourWheelDrive" and public member function "setFourWheelDrive" to set the 
value of this variable.
